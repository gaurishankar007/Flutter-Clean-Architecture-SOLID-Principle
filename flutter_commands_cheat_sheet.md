jdk location should be changed. In case of shorebird, there in commands for changing the jdk location used by it like flutter, so only options remains
to remove the android studio jbr folder so that It will use the JAVA_HOME version in the system variables.

- âœ… `flutter configure --jdk-dir="<java-directory>"`: Change the Java SDK directory used by Flutter.
