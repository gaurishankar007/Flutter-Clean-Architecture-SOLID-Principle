/// Screen widths are in logical pixels (dp).

/// - [unknown]        : Screen type is not detected or supported.
/// - [compact]        : width <= 360 dp — very small phones.
/// - [phone]          : 361 dp to 600 dp — typical smartphones.
/// - [tablet]         : 601 dp to 840 dp — small/medium tablets.
/// - [largeTablet]    : 841 dp to 1024 dp — large tablets.
/// - [desktop]        : > 1024 dp — desktop or very large screen.
