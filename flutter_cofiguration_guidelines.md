## 3. Change Java SDK Location Used by Flutter

By default flutter/shorebird uses the jdk version used by the android studio (C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr) in windows.
Flutter/Shorebird neglects the JAVA_HOME version in the system variables. Therefore, either the android studio jbr should be removed or flutter
jdk location should be changed. In case of shorebird, there in commands for changing the jdk location used by it like flutter, so only options remains
to remove the android studio jbr folder so that It will use the JAVA_HOME version in the system variables.

- ✅ `flutter configure --jdk-dir="<java-directory>"`: Change the Java SDK directory used by Flutter.
